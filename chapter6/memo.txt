To try this out, create the following build script named build.gradle.

Example 6.1. Your first build script build.gradle
    
task hello {
     doLast {
          println 'Hello world!'
     }
}

move to containing directory and execute build script with >grade -q hello


There is a shorthand way to define a task like our hello task above, which is more concise.

task hello << {
    println 'Hello world!'
}
