To try this out, create the following build script named build.gradle.

Example 6.1. Your first build script build.gradle
	task hello {
     		doLast {
          		println 'Hello world!'
     		}
	}

move to containing directory and execute build script with >grade -q hello


Example 6.3. A task definition shortcut
There is a shorthand way to define a task like our hello task above, which is more concise.

task hello << {
    println 'Hello world!'
}


Example 6.4. Using Groovy in Gradle's tasks

task upper << {
    String someString = 'mY_nAmE'
    println "Original: " + someString 
    println "Upper case: " + someString.toUpperCase()
}
